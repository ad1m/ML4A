    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Everytime you turn on the news, log into LinkedIn, or go on twitter there is a highly probable chance that you will come across the term Machine Learning.
    <blockquote>I spend 90pct of my reading time learning about machine learning, neural nets, computer vision, AI, etc. They will dwarf the last 30 yrs tect<br>   &nbsp&nbsp  - Mark Cuban (Tweet)</blockquote>

    Machine learning can help solve complex and real-world problems, and is highly desirable by a majority of public and private companies. Understanding where to begin in learning about machine learning can be tricky as the field has great bredth. There are hundreds of different algorithms for solving myraid different problems and terminology that can be confusing for a beginner in machine learning.This book aims to provide a structured introduction to grasping the concept of machine learning and its application to real-world problems in a concise and intuitive manner. Machine Learning is the future and can solve some really cool problems, so let's get started!

    <h1>Definition</h1>
    <p>Machine Learning does not have one correct definition that has been set in stone there are many interpretations as follows:</p>
    <blockquote> Machine learning is a scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data, such as from sensor data or databases.<br>&nbsp&nbsp- Wikipedia</blockquote>
    <blockquote>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E<br>&nbsp&nbsp- Tom Mitchell</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Machine learning is a field of computer science, probability theory, and optimization theory which allows complex tasks to be solved for which a logical/procedural approach would not be possible or feasible.<br>&nbsp&nbsp- Michael Aaron Safyan</blockquote>
    <p>All definitions above have a common point: Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to make and improve predictions, or behaviors based on some provided dataset. It gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.</p>
 
 	<h1>Example Applications</h1>
 	<p>Machine Learning is applicable in a wide range of problems and industries, some of which are highlighted below:</p>
 	<ul>
 	<li><b>Weather</b> - Predicting the probability whether the weather will be sunny or rainy tomorrow. Also, predicting the specific temperature tomorrow or in some future timeframe.</li>
 	<li><b>Finance</b> - Predicting the direction of the market or the price of a specific stock.</li>
 	<li><b>Facial Recognition</b> - Finding faces in images or recognizing a particular face in an image.</li>
 	<li><b>Sentiment</b> - Predicting whether a tweet contains positive sentiment or negative sentiment.</li>
 	<li><b>Medicine</b> - Diagnosing a patient or recommending drugs and treatments for patients based off of their symptoms.</li>
 	<li><b>Entertainment</b> - Recommend movies or music to consumers based off of their viewing history and reviews.</li>
 	</ul>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Although Machine Learning has had a recent buzz, it has actually been around for over half a century.</p> 
    <p>In 1950, Alan Turing created the 
    "Turing Test" to determine if a computer has real intelligence. To pass the test, the computer must be able to fool a human into believing it is also human. The "Turing Test" has been noted as the start of the field of Machine Learning.</p>
    <p>In 1952, Arthur Samuel of IBM created the first computer learning program, which was designed to play checkers. Each time the computer played a game of checkers, it learned and improved.</p> 
    <p>In 1967, programs were able to recognize patterns based on an algorithm called the nearest neighbor.</p>
    <p>The machine learning field continued to progress with new discoveries until the 1970s when the AI winter hit. This was a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The AI winter was officially over in the 1990s when a resurgence in interest for artificial intelligence was born as computers became more powerful.</p> 

    <h1>Types of Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>There are 3 types of Machine Learning algorithms:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Supervised Learning</b> - Supervised learning is about function approximation. Have labels for your data.</li>
    <li><b>Unsupervised Learning</b> - Unsupervised Learning is about a compact description. Do not have labels for data. Take set of data and figure out how you might divide it up in one wau or the other. Say you have some pictures of men and women with no labels. You might say picures like this belong to males and pictures like this belong to females. You could decide to divide them up on their hair color or shirt color or height or weight. Noone tells you the right way to divide it up, it's summarization - a nice concise description.</li>
    <li><b>Reinforcement Learning</b> - learning from delayed reward. The feedback in reinforcement learning might come several steps after the decision is made.</li>
    </ul>
